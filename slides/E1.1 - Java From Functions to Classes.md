### Tools and artifacts

In the early days of computing science it appeared increasingly evident that with
**increasing complexity** the lines of code contained in a software became more and more
numerous, making its **maintenance more and more complex**.

Several causes can be associated with that historical period, known as the _software crisis_:
- Projects running over-budget
- Projects running over-time
- Software was inefficient
- Software was difficult to maintain

(see more: [Software crisis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_crisis))

| Tools                             | Artifacts                    |

### Errors / 1K SLOC
A simple and informal rule to understand the quality of a software is to measure the amount of
errors per thousand lines of code (_errors / 1K SLOC_).

- Industry Average, 25 errors / 1K SLOC
- Corporate Applications, 5 errors / 1K SLOC
- Cleanroom development technique, 0.5 errors / 1K SLOC

![](images/intro-code-quality-cartoon.png)

Various processes and methodologies have been developed over the last few decades to improve
software quality management such as procedural programming and object-oriented programming.

### Software maintenance costs
- Procedural programming languages (e.g., C) are **not suitable for building large
  software infrastructures** because code reuse is limited. Limited reuse increases both development costs (code written from scratch) and maintenance costs (code written from scratch is less tested than older code).
- OOP aims at secure, re-usable, flexible, extensible software. Instead of focusing on algorithms, optimization, and efficiency, **OOP focus on programming techniques**.

## Procedural vs Objected Oriented
### Procedural approach
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void init(int v[], int size) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    v[i] = rand() % 100;
  }
}

void sort(int v[], int n) {
  int i, j, tmp, changed;
  for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    changed = FALSE;
    for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      if (v[j] > v[j + 1]) {
        changed = TRUE;
        tmp = v[j];
        v[j] = v[j + 1];
        v[j + 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
    if (!changed) break;
  }
}

int search(const int v[], int size, int value) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (v[i] == value) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

void show(int v[], int size) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    printf("[%d] %d\n", i, v[i]);
  }
}

int main() {
  int v[100];
  int n = sizeof(v) / sizeof(v[0]);

  init(v, n);
  sort(v, n);
  search(v, n, 10);
}
```

**Issues**

![](images/intro-issues-procedural-approach.png)

- **Reuse of code limited**: data and operations are separate. This makes it complex to reuse existing code in
  other projects
- **Data protection limited**: unprotected data accessible from vast portions of the source code. After a certain
  stage, debug becomes a nightmare!
- **Decomposition limited**: large scale projects require a large scale working force (many teams). Unprotected
  data, separate from operations, makes it hard to decompose
  
    
### Object-oriented approach
So how does object-oriented programming manage to ensure these differences from the
procedural approach? Defining a new type (a **_class_** of special vectors) consisting in an additional abstraction layer coupling data with operations acting on data.

![](images/intro-object-oriented-approach.png)



```Java
public class Vector {
    int[] v;

    public Vector(int capacity) {
        this.v = new int[capacity];
        init();
    }

    void sort() {
        boolean changed;
        for (int i = 0; i < v.length - 1; i++) {
            changed = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < v.length - i - 1; j++) {
                if (v[j] > v[j + 1]) {
                    changed = true;
                    int tmp = v[j];
                    v[j] = v[j + 1];
                    v[j + 1] = tmp;
                }
            }
            if (!changed) break;
        }
    }
    
    void init() {
      Random rnd = new Random();
      for (int i = 0; i < v.length; i++) {
        v[i] = rnd.nextInt(100);
      }
    }
  
    int search(int value) {
      for (int i = 0; i < v.length; i++) {
        if (v[i] == value) {
          return i;
        }
      }
      return -1;
    }
  
    void show() {
      for (int i = 0; i < v.length; i++) {
        System.out.printf("[%d] %d\n", i, v[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Wrapping up
**Procedural approach**
* Data and functions are separate     
* Functions process data: _operation(object, params)_

```
int main() {
    int v[100];
    int n = sizeof(v) / sizeof(v[0]);

    init(v, n);
    sort(v, n);
    search(v, n, 10);
}
```

**Object-Oriented approach**

* Data and functions are coupled together within classes
* Objects deliver services using internal data: _object.operation(params)_

```
 public static void main(String[] args) {
	 Vector v = new Vector(20);

     v.sort();
     v.show();
     v.search(10);
 }
```

## OOP Features

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is defined as the mechanism wrapping together, inside a protective shield, 
code and data (data is encapsulated inside a shield of code); that prevents the data 
from being accessed by code outside this shield. The rest of the program has access only 
to a selected list of public methods (_public interface_).

![](images/intro-encapsulation.png)

Was it possible before? Data in C language is public by default. Although “Struct” variables can be declared private by defining them separately from the main class. This can be achieved by having a separate header and source C files. A header file is followed by the “.h” extension while C files are followed by the “.C” extension.

```
// point.h 
struct Point {
  double x,y;
};

struct Point* makePoint(double x, double y); 
double distance (struct Point *p1, struct Point *p2); 
```

```
// point.c
#include "point.h"

struct Point* makepoint(double x, double y) {   
  struct Point* p = malloc(sizeof(struct Point));
  p->x = x;
  p->y = y;
  return p;
}

double distance(struct Point* p1, struct Point* p2) {
  double dx = p1->x - p2->x;
  double dy = p1->y - p2->y;
  return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}
```

### Inheritance
Inheritance consists in the mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object. The idea is that you create new classes that are built upon existing classes. 
* The class that inherits (and that can reuse) methods and fields of the parent class is known as **subclass** or **child class**.
* Moreover, it can add new methods and fields or "override" the methods of the **parent class**, also known as **superclass**.
* Every class specializes its ancestors
* Inheritance introduces the **IS A** relationship (_child IS A parent_)
* Enables **reuse of code**

![](images/intro-inheritance.png)

Was it possible before? Single inheritance in C can be achieved by embedding the inherited class attribute structure as the first member of the derived class attribute structure.

For example, instead of creating a NamedPoint class from scratch, you can inherit most what’s common from the already existing Point class and add only what’s different for NamedPoint (i.e., a name). Here’s how you declare the NamedPoint “class”.

```
// namedPoint.h
struct NamedPoint {
  double x,y;
  char* name;
};

struct NamedPoint *makeNamedPoint(double x, double y, char *name);
void setName(struct NamedPoint *np, char *name);
char *getName(struct NamedPoint *np);
```

```
// namedPoint.c
#include "namedPoint.h"

struct NamedPoint *makeNamedPoint(double x, double y, char *name) {
  struct NamedPoint *p = malloc(sizeof(struct NamedPoint));
  p->x = x;
  p->y = y;
  p->name = name;
  return p; 
}

void setName(struct NamedPoint *np, char *name) {
  np->name = name;
}

char *getName(struct NamedPoint *np) {
  return np->name;
}
```

```
// main.c
#include "point.h"
#include "namedPoint.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int ac, char** av) {
  struct NamedPoint* origin = makeNamedPoint(0.0, 0.0, "origin");
  struct NamedPoint* upperRight = makeNamedPoint(1.0, 1.0, "upperRight");
  printf("distance=%f\n", distance(
             (struct Point *) origin,
             (struct Point *) upperRight));
}
```


### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability to provide different implementations 
of an (inherited) method, depending on the type of object that is passed to the method.

> **Tell-Don't-Ask Principle**
> 
> Instead of asking an object about its state and then performing actions,
it is much easier to simply tell the object what it needs to do and let it
decide for itself how to do that.
> 
> _Tell to the parent class to perform an action. The specific implementation
within the child class will do it_

_*signature: method name + ordered list of parameters type_

Was it possible before? Polymorphism in C can be implemented by initializing a 'default structure' containing a function pointer, leveraging linking properties. This allows the program to dynamically select the appropriate behavior based on the data type or situation.

 ```C
// person.h
#ifndef PERSON_H
#define PERSON_H

struct person {
	const char* name;
	const struct nationalityInfo* nazionality;
};

struct nationalityInfo {
	const char* (*greet) (void);
};

static const char* greet(struct person* person) {
	return person->nazionality->greet();
}

extern const struct nationalityInfo ENGLISH[], FRENCH[], GERMAN[];

#endif
 ```

```C
// english.c
#include "person.h"

static const char* sayHello(void) {
    return "hi!";
}

const struct nationalityInfo ENGLISH[] = { { sayHello } };
```

```C
// french.c
#include "person.h"

static const char* sayHello(void) {
    return "bonjour!";
}

const struct nationalityInfo FRENCH[] = { { sayHello } };
```

```C
// german.c
#include "person.h"

static const char* sayHello(void) {
    return "hallo!";
}

const struct nationalityInfo GERMAN[] = { { sayHello } };
```

```C
// main.c
#include "person.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
	struct person elias = { "Elias", GERMAN };
	struct person jhon = { "Jhon", ENGLISH };
	struct person jean = { "Jean", FRENCH };

	printf("%s says %s\n", elias.name, greet(&elias));
	printf("%s says %s\n", jhon.name, greet(&jhon));
	printf("%s says %s\n", jean.name, greet(&jean));

	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
/*
	Output:
		Elias says hallo!
		Jhon says hi!
		Jean says bonjour!
*/
```

### Dependency Inversion
In the typical calling tree (procedural approach), the main function called high-level functions, which called mid-level functions, which called low-level functions. In that calling tree, **source code dependencies inexorably followed the flow of control.**
* **Source Code Dependency**, every caller is forced to mention the name of the module that contains the callee.
* **Flow of Control Dependency**, the runtime line of execution goes from one module to another module.

![](images/intro-typical-calling-tree.png)

When **polymorphism** is brought into play through the addition of interfaces, programmers gain the absolute control over the dependency in the system. 

When designing the interaction between a high-level module and a low-level module, the interaction should be thought of as an **abstract interaction**. Simply put, when components of our system have dependencies, we don't want to directly inject a component's dependency into another. Instead, we should use a level of abstraction between them.

**Dependency Inversion is the strategy of depending upon interfaces or abstract functions and classes rather then upon concrete functions and classes.** Note well: *inversion* does not mean that lower-levels depend on higher-levels. It means that both layers should depend on abstractions. 
* high-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. **Both should depend on abstractions** (i.e., interfaces). 
* abstractions should not depend on concrete implementations. On the contrary, concrete implementations should depend on abstractions.

Suppose _ClassA_ depends on _ClassB_. At runtime, an instance of _ClassB_ will be created or injected into _ClassA_. The flow of control (or the order in which a program is executed) goes from _ClassA_ to _Class B_. 

![before_img](images/intro-dependency-inversion-before.png)

Now, what Dependency Inversion Principle is telling us is to invert the dependency. The flow of control will still follow the same path. However, now both our objects will depend on the abstraction level of the interface. Thus, _ClassB_ inverts its dependency on _ClassA_.

## Towards Microservice Architecture

In recent years, microservices architecture has emerged as a popular approach to designing and building complex software systems. This architecture style breaks down large, monolithic applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This approach has several benefits, including increased agility, scalability, and fault tolerance, among others.
