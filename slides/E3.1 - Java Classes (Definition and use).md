# Java Classes (Definition and use)

![](images/oop-classes-objects.avif)

## Declaring new classes

A new class is declared with the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. A class body can include fields, methods, and constructors. **Fields** store data, **methods** define behavior and **constructors** allow us to create and initialize new objects of the class.


```java
class Patient {
    String name;
    int age;
    float height;

    public Patient(String name, int age, float height) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public void work() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " loves walking!");
    }

    public void workTogetherWith(Patient other) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " loves walking with " + other.name + '!');
    }
}
```

Let's create **instances** of the class `Patient`:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Patient patient1 = new Patient("Heinrich", 40, 182.0f);
    Patient patient2 = new Patient("Mary", 33, 171.5f);
}
```

## Constructors
**Constructors** are special methods that initialize a **new object** of the class. A constructor of a class is invoked when an instance is created using the keyword `new`.

A constructor is different from other methods in that:
* it has the same name as the class that contains it; 
* it has no return type (not even `void`).

Constructors initialize **instances** (objects) of the class. They set values to the fields when the object is created. Also, constructors can take parameters for initializing fields by the given values.

To initialize the fields, the keyword `this` is used, which is a reference to the current object. Usually, the keyword `this` is used when an instance variable and a constructor or a method variable share the same name. This keyword helps to disambiguate these situations.

### Default and no-argument constructor

The compiler automatically provides **a default no-argument constructor** for any class without constructors.

```java
class Patient {
    String name;
    int age;
    float height;
}
```

We can create an instance of the class `Patient` using the no-argument default constructor:

```java
Patient patient = new Patient();
```

If you define a specific constructor, the default constructor will not be created.


### Constructor overloading
You can define as many constructors as you need. Each constructor should have a name that matches the class name but the parameters should be different. The situation when a class contains multiple constructors is known as **constructor overloading**.

```java
class Patient {
    String name;
    int age;
    float height;

    public Patient(String name, int age, float height) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public Patient(int age, float height) {
        this.name = "John Doe";
        this.age = age;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public void work() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " loves walking!");
    }

    public void workTogetherWith(Patient other) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " loves walking with " + other.name + '!');
    }
}
```

### Invoking constructors from other constructors

We can also invoke a constructor from another one. It allows you to initialize one part of an object by one constructor and another part by another constructor.

```java
class Patient {
    String name;
    int age;
    float height;

    public Patient(String name, int age, float height) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public Patient(int age, float height) {
        this("John Doe", age, height);
    }

    public void work() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " loves walking!");
    }

    public void workTogetherWith(Patient other) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " loves walking with " + other.name + '!');
    }
}
```


##  Access modifiers
An **access modifier** is a special keyword that specifies who is allowed to use your code or a special part of it. It can be placed in front of any field, method or the entire class.

**Code clarity.** Imagine your code is a complicated engine of a washing machine. We can cover the engine with the body and add some buttons for choosing a washing mode and starting the process. The user has no need to know what is going on inside the machine's body; the buttons to get the result are more than enough. That's how access control helps in code: you can **"hide" the engine from the user** by restricting access and simply providing them with the public "buttons".

**Code safety.** Now imagine you have developed a rather useful library that is used by other developers. One day some Jane Doe wants to use your code's functionality in her project, but the problem is that she needs to change one variable in one of your classes. If it is public, nothing can stop her from doing that in her code before using method A from the library. What can happen if the variable is used somewhere in method B? The B method would probably start to act unpredictably. So, protecting important parts of your code is a guarantee that it will be **used as an unmodifiable part** and its behavior will be the exact one you have developed it for.

###  Members visibility
A class member (a field or a method, e.g. class constructor) has more options to choose from: **private**, **package-private**, **protected** and **public**. As you can see, there are two additional modifiers here. Let's consider member modifiers in more detail.

-   **private** available only inside a class;
-   **package-private** (also known as **default**, implicit) available for all classes in the same package;
-   **protected** available for classes in the same package and for subclasses (will be covered later);
-   **public** available for all classes everywhere.

| Modifier  | Class | Package | Subclass | All |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|-----|
| Public    | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | Yes |
| Protected | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | No  |
| Default   | Yes   | Yes     | No       | No  |
| Private   | Yes   | No      | No       | No  |

##  Data encapsulation
In most cases, a class does not expose its fields to other classes. Instead, it makes its fields accessible through so called accessor methods. 

According to the **data encapsulation** principle, the fields of a class cannot be directly accessed from other classes. The fields can be accessed only through the methods of that particular class.

To access hidden fields, programmers write special types of methods: **getters** and **setters**. Getters can only read fields, and setters can only write (modify) the fields. Both types of methods should be `public`.

Using these methods gives us some advantages:
- the fields of a class can be made read-only, write-only, or both;
- a class can have total control over what values are stored in the fields;
- users of a class don't know how the class stores its data and don't depend on the fields.

See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1568091/why-use-getters-and-setters-accessors) interesting discussion on the topic! 

```java
class Patient {
    String name;
    int age;
    float height;

    public Patient(String name, int age, float height) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public float getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    public void setHeight(float height) {
        this.height = height;
    }
}
```

## Static and instance methods/fields

### Static methods
Static methods can be invoked directly on the class, instead of an instance. They are often used as **utility methods** that are the same for the whole project. The Java library provides a lot of static methods for different classes. Here are just a few of them:

* the `Math` class has a lot of static methods, such as `Math.min(a, b)`, `Math.abs(val)`, `Math.pow(x, y)` and so on;
* the `Arrays` class has a lot of static methods for processing arrays such as `toString(...)`;

Static methods have several special features:
* a static method can access only static fields and cannot access non-static fields;
* a static method can invoke another static method, but it cannot invoke an instance method;
* a static method cannot refer to `this` keyword because there is no instance in the static context.

```java
public class SomeClass {

    public SomeClass() {
        invokeAnInstanceMethod(); // this is possible here
        invokeAStaticMethod();    // this is possible here too
    }

    public static void invokeAStaticMethod() {
        // it's impossible to invoke invokeAnInstanceMethod() here
    }

    public void invokeAnInstanceMethod() {
        invokeAStaticMethod();  // this is possible
    }
}
```

### Static fields
A **static field** is a field declared with the `static` keyword. It can have any primitive or reference type, just like a regular instance field. A static field has the same value for all instances of the class. It belongs to the class, rather than to an instance of the class.

If we want all instances of a class to share a common value, for example, a global variable, it's better to declare it as static. Static variables can be accessed directly by the class name.

```java
class Physics {

    /**
     * The speed of light in a vacuum (m/s)
     */
    public static final long SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458;

    /**
     * Electron mass (kg)
     */
    public static final double ELECTRON_MASS = 9.10938356e-31;
}
```

To use the constants, let's write the following code:

```
System.out.println(Physics.ELECTRON_MASS); // 9.10938356E-31
System.out.println(Physics.SPEED_OF_LIGHT); // 299792458
```

Static fields with the `final` keyword are **class constants**, which means they cannot be changed. According to the naming convention, constant fields should always be written in uppercase with an underscore (`_`) to separate parts of the name.

## Immutability of objects

There is an important concept in programming called immutability. **Immutable as applied to an object,  means that there are no ways to change its state, i.e. none of its methods change its state, and it has no non-final protected or public fields**. In other words, immutability means that an object always stores the same values. If we need to modify these values, we should create a new object. A common example is the standard **`String`** class. Strings are immutable objects so all string operations produce a new string. Immutable types allow you to write programs with fewer errors.

The class **`Patient`** is not immutable because it is possible to change any field of an object.

```
Patient patient = new Patient();

patient.name = "Mary";
patient.name = "Alice";
```

### Records
Passing immutable data between objects is one of the most common tasks in many Java applications. Commonly, we write classes to simply hold data, such as database results, query results, or information from a service. In many cases, this data is immutable, since immutability ensures the validity of the data.

To accomplish this, we create data classes with the following:
* private, final field for each piece of data
* getter for each field
* public constructor with a corresponding argument for each field
* equals method that returns true for objects of the same class when all fields match
* hashCode method that returns the same value when all fields match
* toString method that includes the name of the class and the name of each field and its corresponding value

For example, we can create a simple Person data class with a name and address:

```java
public class Person {

    private final String name;
    private final String address;

    public Person(String name, String address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // getters only! this is immutable!

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, address);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) {
            return true;
        } else if (!(obj instanceof Person)) {
            return false;
        } else {
            Person other = (Person) obj;
            return Objects.equals(name, other.name)
              && Objects.equals(address, other.address);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person [name=" + name + ", address=" + address + "]";
    }
}
```

Since Java 14, **records** are available to remedy these problems. **Records are immutable data classes that require only the type and name of fields.** The equals, hashCode, and toString methods, as well as the private, final fields and public constructor, are generated by the Java compiler. To create a Person record, we can simply use:

```java
public record Person (String name, String address) {}
```

### Enums
Java 5, first introduced the **enum** keyword. It denotes a special type of class that always extends the java.lang.Enum class. Constants defined this way make the code more readable, allow for compile-time checking, document the list of accepted values upfront, and avoid unexpected behavior due to invalid values being passed in.

```java
public class Pizza {
    public enum PizzaStatus {
        NOT_ASSIGNED,
        ORDERED,
        READY,
        DELIVERED
    }
    private PizzaStatus status = PizzaStatus.NOT_ASSIGNED;
    
    public boolean isDeliverable() {
        return status == PizzaStatus.READY;
    }
}
```

A basic enum type in Java does not contain any public fields, nor any methods that change state. So in this case it would be immutable. However, you can add fields and methods to an enum type. If you add methods that allow you to set fields, for example, then that enum type would be mutable. See the *Resources* Section at the end for more details.

## Sharing references
More than one variable can refer to the same object.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Patient p1 = new Patient();
    Patient p2 = patient;
}
```

### Operations on references
Only the relational operators == and != are defined for object reference:
* The equality condition tells you whether two references point to the same object in memory 
* The equality condition is evaluated on the values of the references (i.e., addresses in memory)!

As for any reference type, a variable of a class type can be **null** which means it is not initialized yet.

```java
Patient patient = null;
```

## Garbage collector
Given the name, it seems like _Garbage Collection_ would deal with finding and deleting the garbage from the memory. However, in reality, _Garbage Collection_ tracks each and every object available in the JVM heap space, and removes the unused ones.

Basically, _GC_ works in two simple steps, known as Mark and Sweep:

* **Mark** this is where the garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which aren’t.
* **Sweep** this step removes objects identified during the “mark” phase.

**Advantages:**
* No manual memory allocation/deallocation handling because unused memory space is automatically handled by _GC_
* No overhead of handling _[Dangling Pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer)_
* Automatic _[Memory Leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak)_ management (_GC_ on its own can’t guarantee the full proof solution to memory leaking; however, it takes care of a good portion of it)

**Disadvantages:**
* Since _JVM_ has to keep track of object reference creation/deletion, this activity requires more CPU power than the original application. It may affect the performance of requests which require large memory. 
* Programmers have no control over the scheduling of CPU time dedicated to freeing objects that are no longer needed. 
* Using some GC implementations might result in the application stopping unpredictably. 
* Automatized memory management won’t be as efficient as the proper manual memory allocation/deallocation.

**GC Implementations**
* Serial: the single-threaded GC, a simple but efficient collector for small memory footprint
* Parallel: the multithreaded GC, ideal for throughput-oriented applications 
* G1: the multithreaded GC, designed to offer a good tradeoff among latency and throughput
* Z and Shenandoah: the new low-latency GCs available from OpenJDK 15

## Wrapper classes

Each primitive type has a class dedicated to it. These classes are known as **wrappers**, and they are **immutable** (just like strings). Wrapper classes can be used in different situations:

* when a variable can be `null` (absence of a value); 
* when you want to use special methods of these classes (e.g., for converting to and from strings).
* when you need to store values in generic collections (will be considered in the next topics); 

The following table lists all primitive types and the corresponding wrapper classes.
As you can see, Java provides eight wrapper classes: one for each primitive type.

| Primitive | Wrapper   |
|-----------|-----------|
| boolean   | Boolean   |
| byte      | Byte      |
| char      | Character |
| int       | Integer   |
| float     | Float     |
| double    | Double    |
| long      | Long      |
| short     | Short     |

### Boxing and unboxing

**Boxing** is the conversion of primitive types to objects of corresponding wrapper classes. **Unboxing** is the reverse process. The following code illustrates both processes:

```
int primitive = 100;
Integer reference = Integer.valueOf(primitive); // boxing
int anotherPrimitive = reference.intValue();    // unboxing
```

**Auto-boxing** and **auto-unboxing** are automatic conversions performed by the Java compiler.

```java
double primitiveDouble = 10.8;
Double wrapperDouble = primitiveDouble;        // autoboxing
double anotherPrimitiveDouble = wrapperDouble; // auto-unboxing
```

### Converting primitive types to and from strings

Wrapper classes can also be used for converting primitive types into strings and vice-versa.

```java
String s = Integer.valueOf(34).toString();
int n = Integer.valueOf("34").intValue();
```

### Comparing wrappers

Just like for any reference type, the operator `==` checks whether two wrapper objects are actually equal, i.e. if they refer to the same object in memory. The method `equals` , on the other hand, checks whether two wrapper objects are meaningfully equal, for example, it checks if two wrappers or strings have the same value.

```
Long i1 = Long.valueOf("2000");
Long i2 = Long.valueOf("2000");
System.out.println(i1 == i2);      // false
System.out.println(i1.equals(i2)); // true
```

Do not forget about this feature when working with wrappers. Even though they correspond to primitive types, wrapper objects are reference types!

### NPE when unboxing

There is one possible problem when unboxing. If the wrapper object is `null`, the unboxing throws a`NullPointerException`**.**

```java
Long longVal = null;
long primitiveLong = longVal; // It throws an NPE
```

Another example is arithmetic operations on numeric wrapper types. They may cause an **NPE** since unboxing is involved.

```java
Integer n1 = 50;
Integer n2 = null;
Integer result = n1 / n2; // It throws an NPE
```
