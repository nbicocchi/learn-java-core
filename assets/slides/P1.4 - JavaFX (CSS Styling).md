## CSS Styling
In JavaFX, you can style your user interface using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It's never been as easy to customize the appearance of a Java application.

In this tutorial we will use a [dark theme](https://github.com/JFXtras/jfxtras-styles) inspired by the Windows 8 Metro design. 


## Getting Familiar with CSS
If you want to style your JavaFX application you should have a basic understanding of CSS in general. A good place to start is this [CSS tutorial](http://www.csstutorial.net/).

For more JavaFX specific information about CSS:

## Default JavaFX CSS
The default source for CSS styles in JavaFX 8 is a file called **`modena.css`**. This css file can be found in the Java FX jar file `jfxrt.jar` located in your Java folder under `/jdk1.8.x/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar`.

Unzip the `jfxrt.jar`. You should find the `modena.css` under `com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/`

This default style sheet is always applied to a JavaFX application. By adding a custom style sheet we can override the default styles of the `modena.css`.   

**Hint:** It helps to look at the default CSS file to see which styles you might need to override.


## Attaching CSS Style Sheets
Download the [theme package](https://github.com/JFXtras/jfxtras-styles)

Copy the `styles` folder located in `jmetro/src/main/resources/jfxtras/` in the `resources` folder of your project.

We now need to attach the CSS to our Scene. We could do this programmatically in Java code, but we'll use the Scene Builder to add it to our fxml files: 


## Attach CSS (person-overview-view.fxml)
1. Open the file `person-overview-view.fxml` in Scene Builder. 

2. Select the root `BorderPane` in the Hierarchy view. Under *Properties* group add the `styles/jmetro/dark_theme.css` file as stylesheet.

3. You might need to adjust the size of the buttons so that all text is displayed.

## Attach CSS (person-edit-view.fxml)
1. Open the file `person-edit-view.fxml` in Scene Builder. Select the root `DialogPane` and choose `styles/jmetro/dark_theme.css` in the *Properties* group as stylesheet.

## Labels with Different Style
Right now, all the labels on the right side have the same size. There are already some styles defined in the css file that we can use to further style the labels.

1. Select the *Person Details* label and add `header` as a Style Class.

2. Now your application should look like the one below:

## Adding an Application Icon
Right now our application just has the default icon in the title bar and taks bar:

![Default Icon](images/javafx-default-app-icon.png)

It looks much nicer with a custom icon:

## The Icon File
A possible place to get free icons is [Icon Finder](http://www.iconfinder.com). I downloaded a little [address book icon](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/86957/address_book_icon#size=32).

Put the icon of your choice inside the **resources** folder. 

![Resources Folder](images/javafx-resources-folder.png)

To set the icon for our scene add the following line to the `start(...)` method in `AddressApplication.java`

```
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("person-overview-view.fxml"));
    Scene scene = new Scene(root);
    stage.setTitle("Address Application");
    stage.getIcons().add(new Image(getClass().getResourceAsStream("icons/address_book_512.png")));
    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}
```
