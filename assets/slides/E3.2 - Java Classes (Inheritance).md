# Java Object Oriented

**Inheritance** is a mechanism for deriving a new class from another class (base class). The new class acquires some fields and methods of the base class. Inheritance is one of the main principles of object-oriented programming. It allows developers to build convenient class hierarchies and reuse existing code.

### Extending classes

When it comes to inheritance, there are several terms. A class **derived** from another class is called a **subclass** (it's also known as a **derived class**, **extended class** or **child class**). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a **superclass** (also a **base class** or a **parent class)**.

To derive a new class from another, the keyword `extends` is used. The common syntax is shown below.

```
class SuperClass { }

class SubClassA extends SuperClass { }

class SubClassB extends SuperClass { }

class SubClassC extends SubClassA { }
```

There are important points about inheritance in Java:

-   Java doesn't support multiple-class inheritance, meaning that a class can only inherit from a single superclass;

-   a class hierarchy can have multiple levels (class `C` can extend class `B` that extends class `A`);

-   a superclass can have more than one subclass.

A subclass inherits all public and protected fields and methods from the superclass. A subclass can also add new fields and methods. The inherited and added members will be used in the same way.

A subclass doesn't inherit private fields and methods from the superclass. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these members can be used inside subclasses.

Constructors are not inherited, but the superclass's constructor can be invoked from the subclass using the special keyword `super`. This keyword is discussed in more detail in another topic.

If you'd like the base class members to be accessible from all subclasses but not from the outside code (excluding the same package), use the access modifier `protected`.


### An example of a class hierarchy
**Inheritance** represents the **IS-A** relationship. A base class represents the general and a subclass represents the particular or specific.

**Inheritance** provides a powerful mechanism for code reuse and writing convenient hierarchies. Many things in the real world can be simulated, like hierarchies from a more general to a more particular concept.

![The class hierarchy for the telecommunication company](https://ucarecdn.com/204baef8-7807-4f39-b853-a3b53de89d14/)

**The class hierarchy for the telecommunication company**

-   the base class `Person` has fields for storing common data: name, year of birth, and address;

-   the class `Client` has additional fields to store the contract number and status (gold or not);

-   the class `Employee` stores the start date of work for the company and the salary;

-   the class `Programmer` has an array of the programming languages a programmer uses;

-   the class `Manager` may have a dazzling smile.

Let's see the code:

```
class Person {
    protected String name;
    protected int yearOfBirth;
    protected String address;

    // public getters and setters for all fields here
}

class Client extends Person {
    protected String contractNumber;
    protected boolean gold;

    // public getters and setters for all fields here
}

class Employee extends Person {
    protected Date startDate;
    protected Long salary;

    // public getters and setters for all fields here
}

class Programmer extends Employee {
    protected String[] programmingLanguages;

    public String[] getProgrammingLanguages() {
        return programmingLanguages;
    }

    public void setProgrammingLanguages(String[] programmingLanguages) {
        this.programmingLanguages = programmingLanguages;
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    protected boolean smile;

    public boolean isSmile() {
        return smile;
    }

    public void setSmile(boolean smile) {
        this.smile = smile;
    }
}
```

This hierarchy has three levels and five classes overall. All fields are `protected` , which means they are visible to subclasses. Each class also has public getters and setters, but some are skipped in the code as these classes use the default no-argument constructor.

Let's create an object of the `Programmer` class and fill the inherited fields using the inherited setters. To read the values of the fields, we can use inherited getters.

```
Programmer p = new Programmer();

p.setName("John Elephant");
p.setYearOfBirth(1985);
p.setAddress("Some street, 15");
p.setStartDate(new Date());
p.setSalary(500_000L);
p.setProgrammingLanguages(new String[] { "Java", "Scala", "Kotlin" });

System.out.println(p.getName()); // John Elephant
System.out.println(p.getSalary()); // 500000
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(p.getProgrammingLanguages())); // [Java, Scala, Kotlin]
```

### Final classes

If a class is declared with the keyword `final`, it cannot have subclasses at all.

```
final class SuperClass { }
```

If you try to extend the class, a compile-time error will occur.

Some standard classes are declared as final: `Integer`, `Long`, `String`, `Math`. They cannot be extended from.

### How to refer to a subclass object

There are two ways to refer to a subclass object:

- **Using the subclass reference**: you can use the subclass reference to refer to its object;
- **Using the superclass reference**: you can use a reference variable of the superclass to refer to any subclass object derived from that superclass because a subclass is a special case of the superclass.

Let's consider an example of a class hierarchy.

```
class Person {

    protected String name;
    protected int yearOfBirth;
    protected String address;

    // public getters and setters for all fields
}

class Client extends Person {

    protected String contractNumber;
    protected boolean gold;

    // public getters and setters for all fields
}

class Employee extends Person {

    protected Date startDate;
    protected Long salary;

    // public getters and setters for all fields
}
```

**Subclass reference**. We can create instances of the subclasses using the constructor:

```
Person person = new Person(); // the reference is Person, the object is Person
Client client = new Client(); // the reference is Client, the object is Client
Employee employee = new Employee(); // the reference is Employee, the object is Employee
```

**Superclass reference**. When creating objects using the constructor, we can refer to a subclass object using the reference to the superclass:

```
Person client = new Client(); // the reference is Person, the object is Client
Person employee = new Employee(); // the reference is Person, the object is Employee
```

Remember, that:

-   you cannot assign an object of one subclass to a reference of another subclass because they don't inherit each other:

```
Client whoIsIt = new Employee(); // it's impossible
```

- you cannot assign an object of the parent class to the reference of its subclass:

```
Client client = new Person(); // it's impossible too
```

The basic rule goes like this: *If class A is a superclass of class B and class B is a superclass of class C then a variable of class A can reference any object derived from that class (for instance, objects of the class B and the class C). This is possible because each subclass object is an object of its superclass but not vice versa.*

### Accessing fields and methods through a superclass reference

We can use a superclass reference for any subclass object derived from it. However, we cannot access specific members of the subclass through the base class reference. We have access only to those members of the object that are defined by the type of reference.

Here is an example; in the considered hierarchy, each class has getters and setters to access protected fields from the outside.

```
Person employee = new Employee();

employee.setName("Ginger R. Lee"); // Ok
employee.setYearOfBirth(1980); // Ok
employee.setSalary(30000); // Compile-time error, the base class "doesn't know" about the method
```

The superclass `Person` doesn't have the method `setSalary` of the class `Employee`. You cannot invoke the method through the superclass reference. The same rule holds for fields.

### Casting between superclass and subclass

You can always cast an object of a subclass to its superclass. It may also be possible to cast an object from a superclass type to a subclass, but only if the object is an instance of this subclass, otherwise a `ClassCastException` will be thrown. Be careful when casting a class to its subclass.

```
Person person = new Client();

Client clientAgain = (Client) person; // it's ok
Employee employee = (Employee) person; // the ClassCastException occurs here
```

After successfully casting a superclass to a subclass, we can access subclass-specific members.

### When to use the superclass reference

When to use a superclass reference in practice may not be so obvious. Moreover, using a superclass reference imposes some restrictions on accessing class members. There are two common cases:

-   processing an array (or another collection) of objects which have different types from the same hierarchy;
-   a method that accepts an object of the base class, but can also work with objects of its subclasses.

What we did is we combined both of these cases into a single example. Our method called `printNames` takes an array of `Person` and displays the names.

```
public static void printNames(Person[] persons) {
    for (Person person : persons) {
        System.out.println(person.getName());
    }
}
```

This method will work for an array with `Person`, `Client` and `Employee` objects.

```
Person person = new Employee();
person.setName("Ginger R. Lee");

Client client = new Client();
client.setName("Pauline E. Morgan");

Employee employee = new Employee();
employee.setName("Lawrence V. Jones");

Person[] persons = {person, client, employee};

printNames(persons);
```

The output is exactly as we expected:

```
Ginger R. Lee
Pauline E. Morgan
Lawrence V. Jones
```

### Accessing superclass fields and methods

The keyword `super` can be used to access instance methods or fields of the superclass. In a sense, it is similar to the keyword `this`, but it refers to the immediate parent class object.

The keyword `super` is optional if members of a subclass have different names from members of the superclass. Otherwise, using `super` is the right way to access hidden (with the same name) members of the base class.

In the following example there are two classes: `SuperClass` and `SubClass`. Each class has a field and a method.

```
class SuperClass {

    protected int field;

    protected int getField() {
        return field;
    }

    protected void printBaseValue() {
        System.out.println(field);
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {

    protected int field;

    public SubClass() {
        this.field = 30;  // It initializes the field of SubClass
        field = 30;       // It also initializes the field of SubClass
        super.field = 20; // It initializes the field of SuperClass
    }

    /**
     * It prints the value of SuperClass and then the value of SubClass
     */
    public void printSubValue() {
        super.printBaseValue(); // It invokes the method of SuperClass, super is optional here
        System.out.println(field);
    }
}
```

In the constructor of `SubClass` , the superclass field is initialized using the keyword `super`. We need to use the keyword here because the subclass field hides the base class field with the same name.

In the body of the method `printSubValue` , the superclass method `printBaseValue` is invoked. Here, the keyword `super` is optional. It is required when a subclass method has the same name as a method in the base class. This case will be considered in the topic concerning overriding.

### Invoking superclass constructor

Constructors are not inherited by subclasses, but a superclass constructor can be invoked from a subclass using the keyword `super` **with parentheses**. We can also pass some arguments to the superclass constructor.

Two important points:

-   Invoking `super(...)` must be the first statement in a subclass constructor, otherwise, the code cannot be compiled;

-   The default constructor of a subclass automatically calls the no-argument constructor of the superclass.

```
class Person {

    protected String name;
    protected int yearOfBirth;
    protected String address;

    public Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, String address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // getters and setters
}

class Employee extends Person {

    protected Date startDate;
    protected Long salary;

    public Employee(String name, int yearOfBirth, String address, Date startDate, Long salary) {
        super(name, yearOfBirth, address); // invoking a constructor of the superclass

        this.startDate = startDate;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    // getters and setters
}
```

In the provided example, the constructor of the class `Employee` invokes the parent class constructor to assign values to the passed fields. In a way, it resembles working with multiple constructors using `this()`.

### The Object class
The Java Standard Library has a class named `Object` that is the default parent of all standard classes and your custom classes. Every class extends this one implicitly, therefore it's the root of inheritance in Java programs. The class belongs to the `java.lang` package that is imported by default.

Let's create an instance of the `Object` class.

```
Object anObject = new Object();
```

The `Object` class can refer to an instance of any class because any instance is a kind of `Object` (*upcasting*).

```
Long number = 1_000_000L;
Object obj1 = number; // an instance of Long can be cast to Object

String str = "str";
Object obj2 = str; // the same with an instance of String
```

When we declare a class, we can explicitly extend the `Object` class. However, there is no point, since the extension is already done implicitly. We advise you to avoid redundancy in your code, but here's an example, just in case:

```
class A extends Object { }
```


### Methods provided by the Object class

The `Object` class provides some common methods to all subclasses. It has nine instance methods (excluding overloaded methods) which can be divided into four groups:

-   **thread synchronization:** `wait`, `notify`, `notifyAll`;
-   **object identity**: `hashCode`, `equals`;
-   **object management**: `finalize`*, *`clone`*, *`getClass`*;*
-   **human-readable representation**: `toString`;

This way of grouping methods isn't perfect, but it can help you remember them. Here's a more detailed explanation of the methods:

-   The first group of methods (`wait`, `notify`, `notifyAll`*)* are for working in multithreaded applications.
-   `hashCode` returns a hash code value for the object.
-   `equals`indicates whether some other object is **"equal to"** this particular one.
-   `finalize` is called by the garbage collector (GC) on an object when the GC wants to clean it up. (**Note: **this method has been deprecated as of JDK 9).
-   `clone` creates and returns a copy of the object.
-   `getClass` returns an instance of `Class`, which has information about the runtime class.
-   `toString` returns a string representation of the object.

Some of the methods listed above are native, which means they are implemented using **native** code. It is typically written in C or C++. Native methods are usually used to interface with system calls or libraries written in other programming languages.



### Overriding instance methods
Java's **method overriding** is a pivotal feature that allows subclasses to redefine behaviors inherited from their superclasses. Think of it as Java's way of letting classes add their own unique flair to inherited methods. It's like giving a classic recipe your own special twist. In this tutorial, we'll explore the essentials of instance method overriding in Java, its rules, and the role of the `@Override` annotation.

Java provides an opportunity to declare a method in a subclass with the same name as a method in the superclass. This is known as **method overriding**. The benefit of overriding is that a subclass can give its own specific implementation of a superclass method.

**Overriding methods** in subclasses allows a class to inherit from a superclass whose behavior is **close enough** and then to change this behavior as the subclass needs.

Instance methods can be overridden if they are inherited by the subclass. The overriding method must have the same name, parameters (number and type of parameters), and the return type (or a subclass of the type) as the overridden method.

```
class Mammal {

    public String sayHello() {
        return "ohlllalalalalalaoaoaoa";
    }
}

class Cat extends Mammal {

    @Override
    public String sayHello() {
        return "meow";
    }
}

class Human extends Mammal {

    @Override
    public String sayHello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
```

The hierarchy includes three classes: `Mammal`, `Cat` and `Human`. The class `Mammal` has the method `sayHello`. Each subclass overrides this method. The `@Override` annotation indicates that the method is overridden. This annotation is optional but helpful.

Let's create instances and invoke the method.

```
Mammal mammal = new Mammal();
System.out.println(mammal.sayHello()); // it prints "ohlllalalalalalaoaoaoa"

Cat cat = new Cat();
System.out.println(cat.sayHello()); // it prints "meow"

Human human = new Human();
System.out.println(human.sayHello()); // it prints "hello"
```

### Rules for overriding methods

There are several rules for methods of subclasses which should override methods of a superclass:

- the method must have the same name as in the superclass;
- the arguments should be exactly the same as in the superclass method;
- the return type should be the same type or a subtype of the return type declared in the method of the superclass;
- the access level must be the same or more open than the overridden method's access level;
- a private method cannot be overridden because it's not inherited by subclasses;
- if the superclass and its subclass are in the same package, then package-private methods can be overridden;
- static methods cannot be overridden.

To verify these rules, there is a special annotation `@Override`. It allows you to know whether a method will be actually **overridden** or not. If for some reason, the compiler decides that the method cannot be overridden, it will generate an error. But, remember, the annotation is not required, it's only for convenience.

### Forbidding overriding

If you'd like to forbid overriding of a method, declare it with the keyword `final`.

```
public final void method() {
    // do something
}
```

Now, if you try to override this method in a subclass, a compile-time error will occur.

### Overriding and overloading methods together

Recall, that **overloading** is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, if their arguments are different.

We can also override and overload an instance method in a subclass at the same time. Overloaded methods do not override superclass instance methods. They are new methods, unique to the subclass.

The following example demonstrates it.

```
class SuperClass {

    public void invokeInstanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("SuperClass: invokeInstanceMethod");
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {

    @Override
    public void invokeInstanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("SubClass: invokeInstanceMethod is overridden");
    }

    // @Override -- method doesn't override anything
    public void invokeInstanceMethod(String s) {
        System.out.println("SubClass: overloaded invokeInstanceMethod(String)");
    }
}
```

The following code creates an instance and calls both methods:

```
SubClass clazz = new SubClass();

clazz.invokeInstanceMethod();    // SubClass: invokeInstanceMethod() is overridden
clazz.invokeInstanceMethod("s"); // SubClass: overloaded invokeInstanceMethod(String)
```

Remember, overriding and overloading are different mechanisms but you can mix them together in one class hierarchy.

### Hiding static methods

Static methods cannot be overridden. If a subclass has a static method with the same signature (name and parameters) as a static method in the superclass then the method in the subclass hides the one in the superclass. It's completely different from method overriding.

```
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SuperClass.staticMethod();          // it prints "super"
        new SuperClass().staticMethod();    // it prints "super"
        SubClass.staticMethod();            // it prints "sub"
        new SubClass().staticMethod();      // it prints "sub"

        SuperClass ss = new SubClass();
        ss.staticMethod();                  // it prints "super", because static method belongs to a class, not to an instance
    }
}

class SuperClass {
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("super");
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("sub");
    }
}
```

You will get a compile-time error if a subclass has a static method with the same signature as an instance method in the superclass or vice versa. But if the methods have the same name but different parameters there should be no problems.

```
class SuperClass {
    public void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("super");
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    // Static method instanceMethod() in SubClass cannot override instance method instanceMethod() in SuperClass
    public static void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("sub");
    }
}
```

### Kinds of polymorphism

In general, **polymorphism** means that something (an object or another entity) has many forms.

Java provides two types of polymorphism: **static (compile-time)** and **dynamic** **(run-time)** polymorphism. The first one is achieved by **method overloading**, the second one is based on inheritance and **method overriding**.

The more theoretical approach subdivides polymorphism into several fundamentally different types:

-   **Ad-hoc polymorphism** refers to polymorphic functions that can be applied to arguments of different types, but behave differently depending on the type of the argument to which they are applied. Java supports it as **method overloading**.
-   **Subtype polymorphism** (also known as subtyping) is a possibility to use an instance of a subclass when an instance of the base class is permitted.
-   **Parametric polymorphism**is when the code is written without mention of any specific type and thus can be used transparently with any number of new types. Java supports it as **generics** or **generic programming**.

In this topic, we consider only **subtype (runtime) polymorphism** that is widely used in object-oriented programming.

### Runtime polymorphic behavior

A reminder: *method overriding* is when a subclass redefines a method of the superclass with the same signature.

Run-time polymorphism relies on two principles:

-   a reference variable of the superclass can refer to any subtype object;
-   a superclass method can be overridden in a subclass.

Run-time polymorphism works when an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass.Java determines at runtime which version of the method (superclass/subclasses) is to be executed based on the type of the object being referred, not the type of reference. It uses a mechanism known as **dynamic method dispatching**.

```
class MythicalAnimal {

    public void hello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I'm an unknown animal");
    }
}

class Chimera extends MythicalAnimal {
    @Override
    public void hello() {
        System.out.println("Hello! Hello!");
    }
}

class Dragon extends MythicalAnimal {
    @Override
    public void hello() {
        System.out.println("Rrrr...");
    }
}
```

We can create a reference to the class `MythicalAnimal` and assign the subclass object to it:

```
MythicalAnimal chimera = new Chimera();
MythicalAnimal dragon = new Dragon();
MythicalAnimal animal = new MythicalAnimal();
```

We can also invoke overridden methods through the base class references:

```
chimera.hello(); // Hello! Hello!
dragon.hello(); // Rrrr...
animal.hello(); // Hello, I'm an unknown animal
```

So, the result of a method call depends on the actual type of an instance, not the reference type. It's a polymorphic feature in Java. The JVM calls the appropriate method for the object that is referred to in each variable.

Subtype polymorphism allows a class to specify methods that will be common to all of its subclasses. Subtype polymorphism also makes it possible for subclasses to override the implementations of those methods. 

### Polymorphism within a class hierarchy

The same thing works with methods that are used only within a hierarchy and are not accessible from the outside.

In the following example, we have a hierarchyof files. The parent class `File` represents a description of a single file in the file system. It has a subclass named `ImageFile`. It overrides the method `getFileInfo` of the parent class.

```
class File {

    protected String fullName;

    // constructor with a single parameter

    // getters and setters

    public void printFileInfo() {
        String info = this.getFileInfo(); // here is polymorphic behavior!!!
        System.out.println(info);
    }

    protected String getFileInfo() {
        return "File: " + fullName;
    }
}

class ImageFile extends File {

    protected int width;
    protected int height;
    protected byte[] content;

    // constructor

    // getters and setters

    @Override
    protected String getFileInfo() {
        return String.format("Image: %s, width: %d, height: %d", fullName, width, height);
    }
}
```

The parent class has a public method `printFileInfo` and a protected method `getFileInfo`. The second method is overridden in the subclass, but the subclass doesn't override the first method.


```
File img = new ImageFile("/path/to/file/img.png", 480, 640, someBytes); // assigning an object

img.printFileInfo(); // It prints "Image: /path/to/file/img.png, width: 480, height: 640"
```

So, **run-time polymorphism** allows you to invoke an overridden method of a subclass having a reference to the base class.
