He eats kids, good or bad ones. They all taste the same to him. He comes
once a year and eats kids. Mostly retards and waterheads but he eats
some regular ones too. He likes to shrink himself and hide inside kids
pillows. Then he wait for kid to go to sleep, then *CRUNCH* he bites off
head. Yummy!!! I like head. He come Christmass eve and eat till full,
usualy 7-9 kids a year then he go to sleep and wait till next time.
Just because you aint scared of monster dont mean he wont eat ya.
Some times eats parents too, forgot to say that earlier.
